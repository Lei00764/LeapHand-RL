# LeapHand with Reinforcement Learning

Utilizing MuJoCo as the simulator, Gym as the environment, and stable-baselines as the suite of reinforcement learning algorithms.

My interest lies in reinforcement learning, and I am currently working on a project that involves training a more complex environment than this one.
